## About me: ##

<p>I have a huge desire to achieve my goals. There are next goals in my list:</p>
<p>Learning HTML, CSS (actually, I’ve learned a large part of it, but there are no limits of perfection);</p>
<p>Learning JavaScript (I’m on the first step and go towards the next);</p>
<p>Learning all necessary information which will help me to go through all this course till the end and get invaluable knowledge.</p>
<p>I work hard every day to improve my knowledge in front-end developing, but at the same time I improve my English skills, because it’s not the less part of self-education in common and studying in the RS School particularly.</p>
<p>I started to learn JS about 2 months ago from a clean sheet, that’s why I don’t have enough skills at this sphere, but I will do all I need to get this knowledge. Now in my portfolio I have several works, doing which I used only HTML and CSS. And one of them it is a real project, but work is in progress now. I will do it during my education using JS.</p>

## Courses, trainings, etc: ##

<p>There are a lot of courses and training in my portfolio. Not all of them relate to IT sphere, but some skills, that I’ve got on it, such as communicability, time management, ability to solve different tasks, can be useful in any sphere. Regarding courses that relate to front-end developing, right now I’m studying at the MyITSchool, where we study almost the same program which I will study in your school. Also I go through on-line training, including HTML-Academy and on-line book learn.javascript.</p>

## English level: ##

<p>About my English level, according Training.by, where I passed an on-line test about two month ago, I have B1 level. But, as I said previously, I continue to study it. I have an English lesson with tutor twice a week.</p>

<p>I’m glad to become a part of your great team!</p>
